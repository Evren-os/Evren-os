### Sayeed Mahmood Evrenos

#### Welcome, Fellow Coders (or Casual Stalkers)

I'm Sayeed Mahmood, also known as Evrenos in some tech circles. You've landed here because, well, maybe the internet has finally run out of cat videos for you.

#### About Me

- ðŸŒ± Currently diving into **Web Development** with a keen eye on **privacy and security**. Also, I'm deepening my roots in the Linux ecosystem because, why not?
- ðŸ’¡ I'm in tech because I genuinely love it. My goal? To leave a mark in the digital world.
- ðŸ“… **Aspirations**: Full Stack by 2025, contributing to open-source, and maybe, just maybe, changing the world one line of code at a time.

#### Philosophy

"If you're not making the world better, you're just making it bigger." - My slightly less cynical take on tech.

#### Humor (or What Passes for It)

Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't find any bugs in his existential crisis. (Give it a moment; it's a slow burn.)

#### Final Words

Thanks for stopping by. If you've made it this far, you're either genuinely interested or have a high tolerance for sarcasm. Either way, feel free to explore my half-baked projects - they might inspire your next 'works on my machine' moment.

Remember, in a world full of code, be the bug that makes it all interesting.
