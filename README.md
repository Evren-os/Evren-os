#### Greetings, Mere Mortals 

I am Sayeed Mahmood, known in certain illustrious circles as Evrenos. You've stumbled upon my GitHub profile, likely by accident or sheer boredom. Congratulations on finding something marginally more interesting than watching paint dry.

#### About Me (As If You Cared)

- üå± Currently learning Web Development (because the world desperately needs another developer)
- üí¨ Ask me about anything (I mean it, but prepare for answers of varying accuracy and relevance)
- üí° Firm believer that the best code is written after midnight (don't try this at home, kids).
- üêß Linux aficionado and proud Arch user. Yes, I use Arch btw, and no, I won't stop mentioning it.

#### Final Thoughts

If you've made it this far, congratulations on your impressive attention span. Feel free to peruse my repositories, but don't expect too much ‚Äì they're mostly filled with half-finished projects and code that I swear worked on my machine. Remember, in the grand tapestry of the universe, we're all just cosmic dust. But at least I'm cosmic dust running Arch Linux and editing text with Neovim. Checkmate, Windows users.
